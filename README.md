# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project applies **Machine Learning models** to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**.  
It uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, and **Logistic Regression** to train and compare performance.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning containing 150 samples with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).  
This project:
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset  
- Splits it into training and testing sets  
- Trains three classifiers (KNN, SVC, Logistic Regression)  
- Evaluates their performance on unseen test data  
- Provides a **Streamlit app** for interactive predictions

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Streamlit (for interactive app)

## ðŸ“Š Models Implemented
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
2. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**  
3. **Logistic Regression**
